		<h3>Expressing my creativity through Coding:</h3>

		<p> Why am I learning? <br/> Computer science has offered me me something that I always looked for, continuous problem solving. When I was pursuing my engineering degree I loved doing derivations. In my engineering studies I had a brief re-kindling with C++, but I naively left it for a particular matrix laboratory. </p>
