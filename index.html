		<h3>Expressing my creativity through Coding:</h3>

		<p> Why am I learning? <br/> Computer science has offered me something that I always looked for, continuous problem solving. When I was pursuing my engineering degree I loved doing derivations. In my engineering studies I had a brief re-kindling with C++, but I naively left it for a particular matrix laboratory. </p>
		</div>



		<div id="Skills", class="AboutMe">
		<!--So what am I doin about it-->
		<h3>Currently I have the following in my utility belt:</h3>
		<!--p>So far I have learned</p-->
		<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Some C# with Unity 4 </li>
		<li>Visual Basic for scripting with Microsoft Office Products</li>
		<li>Enough HTML to make this website</li>	
		<li>MatLab</li>		
		<!--insert jokes about matlab here-->
		</ul>
		<p>Currently I am practicing engineering at NASA, working on the Space Launch System (SLS), yes I use lots of acronyms. Working on the SLS has allowed me to peer review software(c++), and algorithm design (UML models). Also I have participated in the development and review of hardware in the loop Software testing.  </p>
		<p>See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cody-crofford-0567354a/">Linkedin</a> to learn more about my professional skills.</p>

		<div id="Projects", class="AboutMe">
		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<p>In my school projects and in my free time I enjoy absorbing as much knowledge as I can to further develop my skill sets. I have built a couple of games in Unity for with C# and I continue to modify and add to them. I enjoy learning by doing and sometimes learn by breaking and fixing.</p>
		<p>Current Projects I'm working on:</p>
		<!--insert games either as browser plug in or code-->
		<ul>	
		<li>This website</li>
		<li>My GitHub Portfolio <a href="https://github.com/codezor"> Here</a></li>
		<li>Data Structures Projects (to be uploaded)</li>

		<li>Games in Unity with C# (Coming soon) </li>
		</ul>

		<div id="Education", class= "AboutMe">
		<h3>My Formal Education</h3>
		<p>In 2014 I earned my B.S. In Aerospace Engineering from Virginia Tech. <br/>  I am currently fulfilling prerequisites at UAH to qualify for the computer Science Masters program. <br/> </p>
